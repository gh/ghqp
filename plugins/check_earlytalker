=head1 NAME

check_earlytalker - Check that the client doesn't talk before we send the SMTP banner

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hooks connect, checks to see if the remote host starts talking before
we've issued a 2xx greeting.  If so, we're likely looking at a
direct-to-MX spam agent which pipelines its entire SMTP conversation,
and will happily dump an entire spam into our mail log even if later
tests deny acceptance.

Such clients gets a 450 error code.  

=head1 TODO

Make how long we wait before reading from the socket configurable
(currently 1 second)

Make the soft/hard response code configurable (currently DENYSOFT)
