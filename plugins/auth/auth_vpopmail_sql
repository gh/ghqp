=head1 NAME

auth_vpopmail_sql - Authenticate to vpopmail via MySQL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin authenticates vpopmail users directly against a standard
vpopmail MySQL database.  It makes the not-unreasonable assumption that
both pw_name and pw_domain are lowercase only (qmail doesn't actually care).
It also requires that vpopmail be built with the recommended 
'--enable-clear-passwd=y' option, because there is no other way to compare
the password with CRAM-MD5.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Decide which authentication methods you are willing to support and uncomment
the lines in the register() sub.  See the POD for Qspmtpd::Auth for more
details on the ramifications of supporting various authentication methods.
Then, change the database information at the top of the authsql() sub so that
the module can access the database.  This can be a read-only account since 
the plugin does not update the last accessed time (yet, see below).

The remote user must login with a fully qualified e-mail address (i.e. both
account name and domain), even if they don't normally need to.  This is 
because the vpopmail table has a unique index on pw_name/pw_domain, and this
module requires that only a single record be returned from the database.

=head1 FUTURE DIRECTION

The default MySQL configuration for vpopmail includes a table to log access,
lastauth, which could conceivably be updated upon sucessful authentication.
The addition of this feature is left as an exercise for someone who cares. ;)
