Issues
======

transaction should maybe be a part of the connection object instead
of off the main object

plugin support;

  support plugins for the rest of the commands.

  specify a priority in register_hook. ("LAST", "FIRST", "MIDDLE", or
  maybe a number)

  plugin access to the data line by line during the DATA phase.


TRACE in Constants.pm is not actually being used.  Should it be?



Future Ideas
============

Make config() better abstracted or configured (to allow configuration
from LDAP etc).

Make queue() better abstracted or configured (to allow LMTP delivery
instead of using qmail-queue).

Methods to create a bounce message easily; partly so we can accept a
mail for one user but bounce it right away for another RCPT'er.

David Carraway has some thoughts for "user filters"

Make it run as a mod_perl 2.0 connection handler module ...
