Issues
======

Before next release
-------------------

update clamav plugin config to support the latest version properly


Some day...
-----------

Understand "extension parameters" to the MAIL FROM and RCPT TO
parameters (and make the plugin hooks able to get at them).

plugins/queue/qmail-queue is still calling exit inappropriately
(should call disconnect or some such)

add whitelist support to the dnsbl plugin (and maybe to the rhsbl
plugin too).  Preferably both supporting DNS based whitelists and
filebased (CDB) ones.


plugin support;

  allow plugins to return multiple response lines (does it have to
  join them to one for SMTP?)

  support plugins for the rest of the commands.

  specify a priority in register_hook. ("LAST", "FIRST", "MIDDLE", or
  maybe a number)

  plugin access to the data line by line during the DATA phase
  (instead of just after)

  if qmail-queue can't be loaded we still return 250 ?!

Make a system for configuring the plugins per user/domain/...

  support databytes per user / domain

plugin to reject mails from <> if it has multiple recipients.  

localiphost - support foo@[a.b.c.d] addresses 

support smtpgreeting (?)



TRACE in Constants.pm is not actually being used.  Should it be?

Move dispatch() etc from SMTP.pm to Qpsmtpd.pm to allow other similar
protocols to use the qpsmtpd framework. 



Future Ideas
============

Methods to create a bounce message easily; partly so we can accept a
mail for one user but bounce it right away for another RCPT'er.

The data_post hook should be able to put in the notes what addresses
should go through, bounce and get rejected respectively, and qpsmtpd
should just do the right thing.  See also
