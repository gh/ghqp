Issues
======

Use clamd so we don't have to run with a higher memory limit.  Matt
has made a Perl module interfacing clamd; the clamav module should use
that if available.

plugin support;

  support plugins for the rest of the commands.

  specify a priority in register_hook. ("LAST", "FIRST", "MIDDLE", or
  maybe a number)

  plugin access to the data line by line during the DATA phase
  (instead of just after)

  if qmail-queue can't be loaded we still return 250 ?!


TRACE in Constants.pm is not actually being used.  Should it be?

Move dispatch() etc from SMTP.pm to Qpsmtpd.pm to allow other similar
protocols to use the qpsmtpd framework. 



Future Ideas
============

Run under pperl.  There is some perl internals problem with it.  Matt
Sergeant is looking into it.

Methods to create a bounce message easily; partly so we can accept a
mail for one user but bounce it right away for another RCPT'er.

David Carraway has some thoughts for "user filters"
http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.qpsmtpd/2

Make it run as a mod_perl 2.0 connection handler module ...
