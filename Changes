  dnsbl plugin queues lookups in the background upon connect but
  doesn't block for the results until they are needed, greatly
  speeding up connection times.  Also fix a typo in the dnsbl plugin
  so it'll actually work(!).

  <jimw@trainedmonkey.com>)

  Better RFC conformance. (Reset transactions after the DATA command and
  when the MAIL command is being done)


2002/09/08 - v0.10 Released

  New object oriented internals
  
  Very flexible plugin

  All functionality not core to SMTP moved to plugins

  Can accept mails as large as your file system will allow (instead of
