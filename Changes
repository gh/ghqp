0.20 - development

  clamav plugin, thanks to Matt Sergeant, matt@sergeant.org.
  Enabling this might require you to increase your memory limits in
  the run file.  http://www.clamav.org/

  Make the spamassassin plugin not stop the next content plugins from
  running.

  Store hooks runtime config globally so they will work within the
  transaction objects too.

  content_log plugin - log the content of all mails for
  debugging. Robert Spier <robert@perl.org>.

  http_config plugin - get configuration via http

  plugins can take arguments via their line in the "plugins" file

  make the quit_fortune plugin check that the fortune program exists


0.12 - 2002/10/17

  Better error messages when a plugin fails
  
  Remove some debug messages in the log 

  Fix NOOP command with perl 5.6.

  Better installation instructions and error message when no plugin
  allowed or denied relaying (thanks to Lars Rander
  <lrNOSPAM@rander.dk>).
 
  Use /usr/bin/perl instead of the non-standard /home/perl/bin/perl


0.11 - 2002/10/09

  Make a "queue" plugin hook and move the qmail-queue functionality
  to plugins/queue/qmail-queue.  This allows you to make qpsmtpd 
  delivery mail via smtp or lmtp or into a database or whatever you want.

  Reorganize most of Qpsmtpd.pm into Qpsmtpd/SMTP.pm.

  Add spool_dir option (thanks to Ross Mueller <ross@visual.com>)

  Add plugin name to the "hooks" data structure, so we can log plugin
  module had an error when we run a hook.

  Make klez filter run for mails bigger than 220KB; they are sometimes
  bigger than that.

  Avoid "use of uninitialized variable" warning when the "MAIL" or the
  "RCPT" command is executed without a parameter.

  Compatibility with perl 5.5.3.

  Fix "Could not print" error message in the TcpServer object. (Thanks
  to Ross Mueller <ross@visual.com>)

  dnsbl plugin queues lookups in the background upon connect but
  doesn't block for the results until they are needed, greatly
  speeding up connection times.  Also fix a typo in the dnsbl plugin
  so it'll actually work(!).

  check_badmailfrom and check_badrcptto plugins (Jim Winstead
  <jimw@trainedmonkey.com>)

  Better RFC conformance. (Reset transactions after the DATA command and
  when the MAIL command is being done)


0.10 - 2002/09/08

  New object oriented internals
  
  Very flexible plugin

  All functionality not core to SMTP moved to plugins

  Can accept mails as large as your file system will allow (instead of
  up to as much memory you would allow qpsmtpd to eat).

2002/09/08
  Add klez_filter plugin

  Support more return codes for data_post

  Document data_post

  Add plugin name to the log entries when plugins use log()

  Add plugin_name method to the default plugin object.

  Improve error handling in the spamassassin plugin


2002/08/06
  Spool message bodies to a tmp file so we can support HUGE messages
 
  API to read the message body (undocumented, subject to change)

  data_post hook (undocumented)

  SpamAssassin plugin (connects to spamd on localhost), see
  plugins/spamassassin


2002/07/15
  DNS RBL and RHSBL support via plugins.

  More hooks.

2002/07/03

2002/05/09
  Klez filter (thanks to Robert Spier)

2002/04/20
  Bumped version number to 0.07

  Support RELAYCLIENT like qmail-smtpd (thanks to Marius Kjeldahl
  <marius@kjeldahl.net> and Zukka Zitting <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>)

  If the connection fails while in DATA we would just accept the
  message. Ouch! Thanks to Devin Carraway <qpsmtpd@devin.com> for the
  patch.


2002/01/26
  Allow [1.2.3.4] for the hostname when checking if the dns resolves


2002/01/21
  assorted fixes; getting dnsbl's to actually work

  fixing the maximum message size (databytes) stuff (thanks for the
  spot to Andrew Pam <xanni@glasswings.com.au>)

  support and enable taint checking (thanks to Devin Carraway
  <qpsmtpd@devin.com>)

  Make the MAIL FROM host dns check configurable. (thanks to Devin
  Carraway).

  Add more documentation to the README file.
